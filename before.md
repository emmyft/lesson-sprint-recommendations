# Before the Sprint

- **Create an organising committee.**
  Even if this is only two people, it is helpful to share the workload
  and responsibilities.
- **Agree on a code of conduct.**
  If your lesson repository already has a code of conduct,
  apply it to the sprint and associated events too.
  If your lesson repository does not already have a code of conduct,
  add one.
  Like licenses, we do not recommend that you write your own code of conduct from scratch.
  Instead, re-use/adapt an existing text you find online. We recommend
  [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html),
  which was designed with exactly these kinds of project in mind.
- **Have a meeting/video call between all organisers** to agree on
  the timing, format, and high-level objectives of your sprint,
  establish communications norms,
  and divide responsibilities.
  (See below for more details.)
- **Think about the timing of your sprint.**
  Is there any upcoming event e.g. a conference/meeting that many
  in your community will already be engaged with,
  which you could run the sprint in conjunction with?
  If you would like to attract new contributors,
  this will make it easier to get people's attention and
  convince them to block time in their calendar to join in with the sprint.
  You may also be able to tap into the promotional communications etc
  for that event, and/or invite people to join the sprint
  e.g. via a lightning talk or poster.
- **Block time in your calendar _after_ the sprint** for wrap-up/follow-up tasks.
- **Establish communication channels and norms.**
  How will collaborators communicate before, during, and after the sprint?
  We have had success creating a Slack channel for conversations/short updates
  during the sprint. See [During the Sprint](/during.md) for more details.
- **Create guidance for what to work on during the sprint.**
  High-level objectives, defining which sections/aspects of the lesson should be
  worked on during the sprint, will reduce the energy/time required for
  contributors to begin working and help to keep efforts focused during the event.
  This guidance might be in the form of a list on a shared document or
  open issues on the lesson repository,
  and do not need to contain much detail.
  You do not need to micromanage individual contributions,
  but a summary of each key objective can serve as a starting point
  for discussions between collaborators about the best approach
  to reach those goals.
- **Read about good practices in lesson design.**
  To make sure your lesson is as effective as possible, consult
  [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org)
  and think about how you and your collaborators will
  follow those recommendations when creating the lesson material during the sprint.
- **Run a "sprint primer" session.**
  A primer session helps contributors get oriented with the structure of your lesson and its associated repository,
  the setup required to work on the lesson
  (e.g. local builds to preview lesson webpages),
  and the communication channels etc that will be used during the sprint.
- **Consider running a skill-up session for contributors.**
  If your lesson repository is hosted on GitHub or a similar online platform,
  contributors may benefit from learning/being reminded how to use the platform
  and the associated tools on their local system.
  Providing a session/resources on this will also make your
  sprint less intimidating for newcomers to lesson development,
  which may increase participation.
  TODO link to recommended resources on this.
- **Prepare a video call link for all sprint sessions.**
  If your sprint is taking place across multiple sessions,
  or will include multiple video calls between participants,
  try to provide a single meeting link for them all.
  This will save contributors time when returning to the sprint calls
  e.g. for a check-in session or after a break.
