# After the Sprint

- **Capture outstanding tasks in new issues on the lesson repository.** 
  These will help you remember exactly what needs doing when the group next gets together to work on the lesson, 
  and also makes it easier to continue work on the lesson asynchronously.
- **Review open Pull Requests.**
  Sprints often end with an influx of new Pull Requests, as contributors finish up what they were working on as the event closed.
  Other Pull Requests opened earlier in the sprint may be awaiting review.
  Making sure that tehse are reviewed and (where appropriate) merged ensures contributors 
  develop a sense of accomplishment from the sprint,
  and ties up any loose ends before new tasks are taken on to develop the material further.
- **Label issues to encourage asynchronous contributions.**
  Issue labels, such as "help-wanted" and "good-first-issue," provide valuable information to potential contributors
  about where their contributions could be most valuable and how they could begin to get involved with developing
  your lesson.
  Issues labelled "good first issue" will appear automatically on the `/contribute` page of your repository,
  providing a quick overview of ways to get involved that have a low barrier for entry.
  Other labels can be used in a similar way to automatically display listings of issues to potential contributors.
  For example, The Carpentries publishes [a Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) that provides their community with an overview of
  open issues with the "hel-wanted" label on many of their repositories.
- **Write up an overview of the sprint and share it with your contributors.**
  A summary of progress made and next steps (with links to open issues/work-in-progress pull requests)
  will help you and your contributors appreciate the progress made during your sprint,
  and encourage efforts on the lesson to continue.
