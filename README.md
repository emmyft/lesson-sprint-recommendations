# Lesson Sprint Recommendations

Recommendations for those who want to organise a coordinated, synchronous effort to create/improve their lesson materials.

The recommendations are relevant to a lesson sprint consisting of a single session or in multiple sessions with breaks between, whether on one day or multiple consecutive days. We have tried to note where a particular recommendation is only relevant or particularly relevant to a sprint being run across multiple days/sessions. These recommendations were written with a particular focus on sprints taking place virtually, i.e. with participants meeting by video conference, but many of the recommendations (especially those in the [Before](before) and [After](after) sections) are also relevant to in-person events.

## Target Audience

The target reader is one of the lead developers/maintainers of a lesson under development. 
They should have a clear idea of the target audience and main learning objectives for their lesson, 
even if they haven't started writing the actual material yet.
They may be planning to teach the lesson for the first time, 
or have recently taught it for the first time, 
and now want to improve the lesson material based on feedback collected when teaching.

If you in the stage where you are not yet clear on the target audience or the overall learning objectives for your lesson, we suggest you take a look at [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/) first before returning to this guide. 


## Objectives

Provide practical tips and more theoretical guidance about how to:

- organise an inclusive and accessible sprint
- make the most of a dedicated lesson sprint
- create coherent lesson material from individual contributions made during the sprint
- engage contributors before, during, and after the lesson sprint

Targed audience and high level objectives are among the first things to settle on as part of your [lesson planning process](lesson_planning.md).
